# BlizzardBars Mouseover
> Hides the default Blizzard bars, shows them on mouseover.

Does what the title says. *Taintless, fast, and small!*

There are no configurations, no per-bar setting. All or nothing, for now.

Bars become and stay visible under the following conditions:
- Mouseover
- Edit Mode
- Quick Keybind Mode
- Bar has Spell Flyout open (e.g. Pet Utility or Summon Demon)
